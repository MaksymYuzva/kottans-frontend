<summary><h1>Front-End Basics</h1></summary>

## Intro to HTML and CSS
- **HTML**. Everything was familiar for me, but I have learnt a bunch of new tags like: input, video, audio, embed, figcaption. And also  target="_blank" was a new attribute for me. I definitely will use it.

- **CSS**. Something i knew before, but I have learnt much more. I have improved my knowledge about box model, margin, position, difference between display: block and display:  inline-block and the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden, z-index. Also i've discovered how to reset default of browser by applying star style, and it was astonishing to get to know a lot of values of color property. All of this information is definitely come in handy.

## Responsive Web Design
- Roughly everything was a new thing for me. I have discovered a lot of information about responsive web design. It was really excited to get to know flexbox and grid layout and how to use them in practice. It is powerful! I definitely will try to use both of them, but I will  put an emphasis on grid layout because as for me, it has a little bit more possibility than flexbox.
